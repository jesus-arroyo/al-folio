I recently finished my postdoc in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www-math.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park. In August 2021, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University.

My research interests include statistical network analysis, machine learning, high-dimensional data analysis, and applications to neuroimaging.

### About

From 2018 to 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University and at the University of Maryland, College Park, working with Professor [Vince Lyzinski](https://www.math.umd.edu/~vlyzinsk/) at UMD, and with Professors
[Carey E. Priebe](http://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) and [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) at JHU. 

I completed my PhD in Statistics at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats), advised by Professor [Liza Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/). I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM)](http://www.itam.mx).
