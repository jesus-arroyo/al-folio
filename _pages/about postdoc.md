am a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www-math.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park, and an Adjunct Assistant Research Scientist in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University. I work with Professor [Vince Lyzinski](https://www.math.umd.edu/~vlyzinsk/) at UMD, and with Professors
[Carey E. Priebe](http://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/) and [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) at JHU. 

My research interests include statistical network analysis, machine learning, high-dimensional data analysis, and applications to neuroimaging.

Before, I completed my PhD in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor [Liza Levina](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~elevina/). I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM)](http://www.itam.mx).
