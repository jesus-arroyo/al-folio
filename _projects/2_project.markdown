The *multiple adjacency spectral embedding (MASE)* performs a joint embedding of graphs based on a common invariant subspace assumption . Check our pre-print ["Inference for multiple heterogeneous networks with a common invariant subspace"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10026.pdf) for the details. 

Code for MASE is available in the following links:

* [R code](https://github.com/jesusdaniel/mase).
* [GraSPy](https://graspy.neurodata.io/) (Python package) contains an implementation of this method.
